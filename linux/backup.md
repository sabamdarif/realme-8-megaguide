# Installing prerequisites

1. Install `libusb`
2. Verify that `python` installation is newer than **`3.9`**

---

# I. Backup

1. Prepare a folder in which to store backed up partitions. For this example we'll use `firmware-backup`.

2. Turn your phone off, hold both volume buttons, run this command `python mtk rl --skip userdata,super "firmware-backup"` and connect your phone to your computer.

##### This is what will show while the backup is running:

2. After the command finishes, check the folder to make sure the backup was made to the correct location and that there are _51 files_

# You are ready. Continue to [Landing](/linux/landing.md)

# II. Restore

1. Flash a firmmware package (example: [C.18](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YHSIr4itg_5dPE2IbWAH9N8g6L5CGmaG/view?usp=drive_link))

2. Run `python mtk wl (folder name)` in a command prompt. (To only flash some files use `python mtk w (partition) (file name)`)

> [!CAUTION]
>
> ## ❗ A preloader file will be backed up inside `mtk client` folder. Keep that file as safe as possible, as it's crucial to restoring the firmware.
>
> ## ❗ ONLY FLASH YOUR OWN FIRMWARE OR THE FIRMWARE PROVIDED IN THE GUIDE (exclude `cdt_engineering` AND `opporeserve2` for those)
